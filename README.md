# cplusplus-tic-tac-toe

## This is the repo for my first attempt at a C++ console app version of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe.

I am using the structure I used when learning Python in 2023.

For this C++ version I am using CMake and Ninja for build setup and generator. This is my introduction to both of these systems, so my setup is very basic indeed, just providing the bare minimum to allow me to build the application on both my Windows 11 pro and Ubuntu 22 developer plaforms from the same code base.

Next Stage: To incorporate a basic AI level of play capability for the computer, whereby we get the computer to analyse the best possible next move.... Minimax algorithm... and can we then look to create a library of Algorythms the computer could use, so that we introduce a complexity/difficulty scoring system, whereby the use can choose a level of difficulty at the start of the game and then the computer chooses the appropriate algorythm???
